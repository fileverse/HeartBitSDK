# HeartBitSDK

## Introduction

### Overview
HeartBit is a free open-source SDK to deploy time-based ‘onchain likes’ to any dApp and  website. The SDK is designed for easy integration and enables a new metric for user interaction, broadening the scope of how appreciation and engagement are quantified onchain. HeartBit is currently compatible with Base and will soon be available across most EVM-based chains.

### Why HeartBit? 

The SDK introduces a new way to engage onchain, transforming how appreciation is expressed. Unlike traditional web2 likes which are ephemeral and hold no tangible value, HeartBit lets users share their time - a sincere, measurable token of appreciation for content they love. This onchain metric not only adds value but also depth to user interactions: it’s a meaningful way to show onchain love.

With just a click on a heart, up to 6 seconds, users can give HeartBits to their favorite content. Each second a user stays clicked up mints ERC1155 tokens. Now every dApp; NFT; digital garden; video; article; web page etc. can have granular onchain analytics. Deepen your users’ analytics from Daily/Monthly Active Users to Seconds Active Users. 


### Supported Networks
We currently only support Base and Sepolia
